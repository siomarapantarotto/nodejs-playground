# Node.js Playground

This repo is my playground to tinker around with a few things:

- Node.js
- JavaScript
- Express
- MongoDB, a NoSQL database

<b>Node.js</b> is a tool written in C++, which basically wraps the V8 engine, just like web browsers, and lets us write code in JavaScript and share it between the front end and back end of our projects.

<b>Express</b> is a lightweight and flexible web application framework in JavaScript that simplifies building server-side applications and APIs with Node.js, handling routing and HTTP requests. 

<b>MongoDB</b> is a super flexible NoSQL database that is a great fit for certain types of applications where a traditional, structured database might not be the best choice. 

Node.js adds more features:

-  Read & write files on a computer
-  Connect to a database
-  Act as a server for content
-  Etc
